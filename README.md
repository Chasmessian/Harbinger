# Harbinger
Harbinger is an idea for a HTML5 Canvas animation library.
Planned features:
Timeline and keyframes.
Easy shape and image manipulation. 
I plan on researching into 3d graphics and see if I can include a 3d aspect to the library as well.

this is currently, incredibly poorly written, this is mostly an experiment I hope can grow to be something useful
