Check for position and (scale?): make parts of shape class relative to center point

add rotation functionality
noted: built-in rotation is around the origin, which makes sense but is annoying

change parent canvas to parent scene so that a scene can be loaded into different canvases

add camera???

test shape class such as moving nodes

better node system and overall system for adding and creating objects

test ability to change scene

add spline functionality

add Components, including preRender() and postRender()

components start with basic filters such as dropshadow, maybe glow, plus color filters, perhaps motionBlur

create masks and masking features

image support including: PNG, JPEG, and SVG

look into shaders for scenes

design timeline and keyframe system

create more Easing patterns

consider an editor that allows you to drag and drop components to make animations without too much code
